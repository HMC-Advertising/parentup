<h3>Monitor your teen when he goes out</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:20px; font-size:16px;"><strong>Before your teen goes out, make sure you talk with her about the following:</strong></div>
<ul>

</strong>

    <li>Do you know your curfew?</li>
    <li>Do you know the consequences of breaking curfew?</li>
    <li>Where are you going?</li>
    <li>What are you doing?</li>
    <li>Who will you be with?</li>
    <li>Will alcohol or drugs be present? What will you do if they are?</li>
    <li>Will there be adult supervision?</li>

</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:20px; font-size:16px;"><strong>When your teen returns, check for the following:</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li>Is your teen easily able to talk with you? Is he coherent?</li>
    <li>Is there a smell of alcohol, smoke, or other strange odors, on her clothing or breath?
Know the other warning signs of a possible problem. And be prepared in advance for what you will do the FIRST time you discover that your teen has been drinking or using drugs. Think ahead about how you want to react, who you will talk to, and how you will enforce the consequences.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:20px; font-size:16px;"><strong>Talk about what happened while your teen was out:</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li>Were there any problems or peer pressures? If so, how did she handle it? How did she feel about it?</li>
    <li>Were drugs or alcohol present? If so, was he concerned about putting himself or others at risk? What was or could have been done to prevent problems?</li>
    <li>Was there adult supervision? Was it adequate to keep people safe?</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pay extra attention during times of transition</h3>
<div style="margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:20px; font-size:16px;"><strong>If you’re in the midst of a divorce, move, serious illness in the family, or even the transition from grade school to middle school or middle school to high school:</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li>Keep a focus on your child’s needs</li>
    <li>Monitor behaviors and activities even more than usual</li>
    <li>Encourage your child to talk with you about her feelings</li>
    <li>Schedule regular time for one-on-one activities with your child</li>
</ul>
