Show me how to take action
Together with your kids, do something for someone else, whether it’s making a financial contribution, baking cookies, or helping someone out.
Make and send cards to hospitalized children, nursing home residents, or people in the military.
Organize a community or neighborhood “closet-cleaning day.” Deliver everything you collect to a shelter or thrift store.
Provide foster care for a pet through an animal shelter or for a friend or neighbor who is out of town or ill.
Organize or participate together in a fundraiser such as a walk or run. Donate the proceeds to hurricane relief, camp scholarships, or other causes.
