Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>

Solicit young people’s input in all decisions that affect them. If you’re on a decision-making board, invite young people to be members—and then really listen to what they have to say.</li><li>

If you’re in charge of a fund-raising or charity event, involve your children or students. They will learn by watching you in action, but they will learn even more if they’re given a meaningful task to complete.</li><li>

Encourage kids to mentor their peers. Teach them how they can help other youth by listening to them and helping them work through their problems.</li></ul><p>
