Show me how to take action
Don’t always bail your kids out of trouble. Help them learn from mistakes.
Don’t nag or rescue your kids when they forget to follow through on a responsibility. Let natural consequences occur (eg, kids who don’t put their dirty clothes in the laundry basket run out of clean clothes to wear).
Talk about the cost of things you buy and how you make decisions about what to spend.
If you have a pet, encourage your child to take on more responsibility for pet care as he or she matures. If your child is interested in getting a pet, work with her or him to do plenty of research on the care needed for the type of animal you are considering.
