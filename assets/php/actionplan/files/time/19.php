Show me how to take action:</strong></p><p>
Adapt your religious and spiritual practices to match your child’s developmental abilities. Children this age may only be able to site 10-15 minutes (or less) at one time. Offer a quiet activity or book to keep your child engaged.</p><p>
Encourage your child to talk about her interpretations of spiritual or religious concepts, asking questions to clarify comments, rather than judging what she says.</p><p>
It’s okay for your teen to seek out adult mentors with deep spiritual commitments or practices, even if those practices differ from your own. Exposure to different cultures and belief systems can help him evaluate and define his own.</p><p>
Keep talking with and listening to your child, even if she says things about religion or spirituality that worry or disappoint you.</p><p>
Together, read stories and enjoy music and other creative arts that have religious or spiritual themes.</p></div></div><div class="page-break"></div>
