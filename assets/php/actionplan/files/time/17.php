Show me how to take action
Hand down a hobby. Teach a young person a skill, such as quilting, carpentry, or gardening.
Help your children—at every age—find positive outlets for their creative energy. This might include classes, crafts, physical activities, drama, or more.
If you played an instrument when you were younger, take a refresher course. Then set a good example and practice often. Or join a choir, try out for a play, pick up a paintbrush, or write a poem. Share your excitement with your children.
