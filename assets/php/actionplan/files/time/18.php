Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
Scouts and other youth groups are great places for young people to build strong, supportive relationships. Explore youth group opportunities.</li><li>
Suggest that your kids join a local organization for the summer as a counselor or mentor for children.</li><li>
Encourage your teens to be involved in some out-of-school programs or activities. If they arenâ€™t interested in options at school, help them identify and research opportunities in your community. Carefully chosen part-time jobs or volunteer situations can also be worthwhile endeavors for teens.</li><li>
If you think it would help your child, look into a formal mentoring program through your school or a community organization.  Many programs can match kids this age with an adult who will be a supporter and friend for years to come.
Many young people have an interest in clubs and organizations at school that do fund-raising for causes worldwide. Encourage their leadership and participation.</li></ul><p>
