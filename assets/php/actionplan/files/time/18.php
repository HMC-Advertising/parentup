Scouts and other youth groups are great places for young people to build strong, supportive relationships. Explore youth group opportunities.</li><li>

Encourage your teens to be involved in some out-of-school programs or activities. If they arenâ€™t interested in options at school, help them identify and research opportunities in your community. Carefully chosen part-time jobs or volunteer situations can also be worthwhile endeavors for tends.</li><li>

Many young people have an interest in clubs and organizations at school that do fundraising for causes worldwide. Encourage their leadership and participation.</li></ul><p>
