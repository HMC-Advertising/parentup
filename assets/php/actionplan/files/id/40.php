Show me how to take action
Encourage your children to spend time in their high school guidance office, reading through career and college planning materials.
Talk to your teenagers about how they feel about themselves and what they envision for their future.
If your teenager is passionate about animals, encourage her or him to consider education or career paths that involve animals when she or he considers post-high school opportunities. There are many.
Ask your kids about their goals and dreams. Help them think about the resources (financial and otherwise) they will need to make these goals a reality.
