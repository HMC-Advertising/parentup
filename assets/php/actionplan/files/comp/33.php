Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
Remind your children that they need to treat you with respect, such as saying please and thank you, and acknowledging your presence!</li><li>
Make it a policy to never speak poorly of others in your home.</li><li>
Use “active listening” with your children: Ask good questions, paraphrase what they say to make sure you understand, and show that you empathize with what they are saying.</li><li>
Teach your children—through modeling and explanation—how to use “I” statements to express feelings to one another without making accusations (for example: “I feel angry when you say that,” instead of “You make me so mad,” or “You are so stupid.”
Encourage your child to develop friendships of all ages in a number of difference settings, such as school, a faith community, your neighborhood, or your extended family.</li></ul><p>
