Show me how to take action
Remind your children that they need to treat you with respect, such as saying please and thank you, and acknowledging your presence!
Make it a policy to never speak poorly of others in your home.
Use “active listening” with your children: Ask good questions, paraphrase what they say to make sure you understand, and show that you empathize with what they are saying.
Teach your children—through modeling and explanation—how to use “I” statements to express feelings to one another without making accusations (for example: “I feel angry when you say that,” instead of “You make me so mad,” or “You are so stupid.”
Encourage your child to develop friendships of all ages in a number of difference settings, such as school, a faith community, your neighborhood, or your extended family.
