Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
Pay attention to what you say and how you say it about people, the world, ideas, and so on. Your kids are learning from you.</li><li>
Teach your kids that everybody has personal values, even though others’ may be different from their own.</li><li>
Attend cultural events and festivals in your community. If you don’t know of any, try asking a librarian or calling your local Chamber of Commerce.</li><li>
When you watch television, see a movie, or play a video game with your children, talk about the subtle messages about diversity. Do all the characters look, sound, or dress a certain way? Are there stereotypes that are reinforced or dispelled? What’s implied about the positive and negative aspects of certain characteristics?</li><li>
Encourage your teens to have “multicultural” experiences by visiting museums, cultural festivals or centers, congregations, or other places where people who share a common culture gather.</li></ul><p>
