Show me how to take action:</strong></p><p>
When your children receive long-term school assignments, offer to help them plan and make decisions in order to finish on time.</p><p>
Talk children through planning ahead by asking “what if” questions. This will help them think about what needs to be done and identify possible consequences of their decisions.</p><p>
Encourage your teen to get involved in a long-term project (one that involves planning and coordination) at school or in the community.</p><p>
Be intentional about letting kids make plans for a family party or event. Let them help make guest lists, plan the budget, shop for food and decorations, and enlist family members to make the event a success.</p><p>
Provide your children with daily planners to help them organize their homework assignments, tests, and after-school activities.</p></div></div>
