Show me how to take action
When your children receive long-term school assignments, offer to help them plan and make decisions in order to finish on time.
Talk children through planning ahead by asking “what if” questions. This will help them think about what needs to be done and identify possible consequences of their decisions.
Encourage your teen to get involved in a long-term project (one that involves planning and coordination) at school or in the community.
Be intentional about letting kids make plans for a family party or event. Let them help make guest lists, plan the budget, shop for food and decorations, and enlist family members to make the event a success.
Provide your children with daily planners to help them organize their homework assignments, tests, and after-school activities.
