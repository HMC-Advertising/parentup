Show me how to take action
Tell other parents when you see their children being responsible or generous in their actions. Try to find opportunities to praise more often than you report misbehavior.
Make your home one that kids want to come to. If kids get rowdy in your home, be calm but firm in re-establishing order.
Meet the parents of your childrenâ€™s friends. If your preteen wants to go with friends to a movie or the mall without you, call other parents and agree on pick-up times and movie choices.
