Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
Tell other parents when you see their children being responsible or generous in their actions. Try to find opportunities to praise more often than you report misbehavior.</li><li>
Make your home one that kids want to come to. If kids get rowdy in your home, be calm but firm in reestablishing order.</li><li>
Meet the parents of your children’s friends. If your preteen wants to go with friends to a movie or the mall without you, call other parents and agree on pickup times and movie choices.</li></ul><p>
