Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
Make sure you and your children know the school rules about dress and appearance, and know the consequences for violating them.</li><li>
School should feel safe to children. If your child is being teased or bullied—in the classroom, on the playground, or to and from school—be sure to talk to your child’s teacher. Great resources are available for teachers and parents to work through bullying issues, so speak up as soon as you believe this is an issue.</li><li>
