Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
If you parent with a partner, make sure you work on keeping that relationship happy and healthy. You, your partner, and your kids will all benefit.</li><li>
Know when to tell your children you’re sorry. Keep it honest and sincere, avoiding the temptation to soothe your own conscience by offering gifts or other indulgences unrelated to the situation.</li><li>
Show them that you are brave enough to try again, even when you feel embarrassed.</li><li>
Make sure children hear adults solving problems in peaceful ways—not with shouting, angry words, or hitting. If you and your child witness bullying or intimidation by adults or children, point it out, talk about it, and think of alternate ways the situation could have been handled.</li><li>
Model for your children hard work, a good attitude, and respect for others. Avoid bad-mouthing coworkers, sports teams or players, and other with whom you compare yourself or compete.</li></ul><p>
