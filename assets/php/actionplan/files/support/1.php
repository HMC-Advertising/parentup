Show me how to take action</strong></p><p>
Start family traditions and rituals such as family service, game nights, season outings, or family meetings.</p><p>
Give kids space and respect their privacy when they need it.</p><p>
Give each of your kids a hug today, even if they’re really big kids.</p><p>
Spend time each week with each of your teenagers individually.</p><p>
Create a small memory book, memory box, photo album, or private Web site for each of your children.</p><p>
If you don’t live in the same city as your child, create a care package that includes a pack of cards; a book of crossword puzzles, word jumbles, or drawing activities; and some colorful pens, pencils, or markers.</p><p>
