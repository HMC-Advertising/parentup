Show me how to take action
Ask neighbors to include their areas of expertise (computers, math, English arts) in a “homework helpers” list to distribute to students. Then encourage students to call neighbors when they need specific help.
Sit near your children when they’re doing homework, and do work of your own: write a letter, pay bills, balance your checkbook, or read work-related material. Continue this routine as children grow older.
Encourage children who participate in after-school childcare programs to do at least some of their homework there so that you have more family time in the evenings.
Encourage your children to form study groups with other students when appropriate. Help them outline complex material, and teach them how to read and evaluate arguments with a critical eye.
When your children ask for help, provide guidance (but don’t give them all the answers right away). Remember, children only need to do their best, not your best.
