Show me how to take action:</strong></p><ul><li>
Ask neighbors to include their areas of expertise (computers, math, English arts) in a “homework helpers” list to distribute to students. Then encourage students to call neighbors when they need specific help.</li><li>
Sit near your children when they’re doing homework, and do work of your own: write a letter, pay bills, balance your checkbook, or read work-related material. </li><li>
Continue this routine as children grow older.</li><li>
Encourage children who participate in after-school childcare programs to do at least some of their homework there so that you have more family time in the evenings.</li><li>
Encourage your children to form study groups with other students when appropriate. Help them outline complex material, and teach them how to read and evaluate arguments with a critical eye.</li><li>
When your children ask for help, provide guidance (but don’t give them all the answers right away). Remember, children only need to do their best, not your best.</li></ul><p>
