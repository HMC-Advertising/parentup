Show me how to take action:</strong></p><p>
Bring a young person to look for books at garage sales, rummage sales, and second-hand stores.</p><p>
Ask children to read to you as they learn to read. Show them that you are excited and proud about their reading.</p><p>
Ask a teenager to recommend a favorite book. Read the book and start a discussion later about the character’s values.</p><p>
Give your child books and magazine subscriptions as birthday and holiday presents.
Make it a family ritual to read together in the evening—with the television, cell phones, and computers turned off!</p><p>
