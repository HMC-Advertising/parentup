Show me how to take action
You can never “overpraise” a child’s abilities. The more able a child feels, the more likely she or he is to continue pursuing ambitious goals.
Use spontaneous rewards with no strings attached. If you expect children to work hard and learn new skills, they probably will. Instead of saying, “I’ll take you to the park if you finish your assignment,” say, “You finished your assignment? Great! Let’s go to the park to celebrate.”
Set goals together that will motivate your child. Choose goals that are easy, simple, and doable. For examples, goals could include, “I will raise my hand to participate at least one more time a day,” or “I will ask my teacher or dad for help when I don’t understand something.”
Monitor your teenager’s stress levels. Some find high school academically competitive and can psych themselves out. Others think high school is a waste of time and try to do the minimum. Talk about how high school is a key part of your child’s life and how he can make the most of it.
