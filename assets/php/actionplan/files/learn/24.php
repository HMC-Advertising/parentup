Show me how to take action:</strong></p><p>
If you are able, purchase school t-shirts, caps, sweatshirts, or other school clothing that’s for sale. Wearing these items helps children show pride in their school.</p><p>
Participate with your child in service projects, such as food drives, conducted by the school. Invite one of your child’s friends to join you.</p><p>
Show that you care about your child’s school. Join a parent-teacher organization, attend conferences and special events, and volunteer in any way you can.</p><p>
Listen to your teenager when he complains about school or talks about not feeling connected. Is there a specific problem?</p><p>
Don’t forget to identify on caring adult at school as your family’s “ally.” Aim for at least five caring adults in your teen’s life.</p><p>
