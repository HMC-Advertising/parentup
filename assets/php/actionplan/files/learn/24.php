Show me how to take action
If you are able, purchase school t-shirts, caps, sweatshirts, or other school clothing that’s for sale. Wearing these items helps children show pride in their school.
Participate with your child in service projects, such as food drives, conducted by the school. Invite one of your child’s friends to join you.
Show that you care about your child’s school. Join a parent-teacher organization, attend conferences and special events, and volunteer in any way you can.
Listen to your teenager when he complains about school or talks about not feeling connected. Is there a specific problem?
Don’t forget to identify on caring adult at school as your family’s “ally.” Aim for at least five caring adults in your teen’s life.
